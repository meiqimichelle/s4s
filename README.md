# Science for Society Solutions (s4s)

### What is the problem?

Right now, the problem is that dryland earth environmental science doesn't have access to participatory methods of stakeholder engagement. This leads to decisions that are made without the stakeholder in mind. For example, the outreach component of grant funding requires that research be applicable and usable. If you have a scientist whose been working on the bench on in the field, that person doesn't necessarily have to experience to know how to make their research applicable to people, make it useable. 

### What we're trying to do

s4s want to solve this problem by creating a resource for such scientists to learn about participatory methods so that they can better make their research usable by their target audiences. The project also hopes to create a community of practice (experts in the field of participatory methods) to the community of interest (earth science researchers).

### Where we are

So far, we made a first version of a wiki to test a potential structure for making easy for contributors to contribute. We tested this with potential contributors and are now working on a version two to test again.
